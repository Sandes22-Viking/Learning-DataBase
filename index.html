        <h2>What is a database?</h2>
        <p>Database is a organized collection of structured information, typically stored electronically in a computer system. A database is usually controlled by <abbr title="database management system">DBMS</abbr>. Along with the applications that are associated with them, they're called of database system</p>
        
        <h2>Why use a database?</h2>
        <ul style="list-style-position: inside;">
            <li>Databases can store very large numbers of records efficiently (they take up little space).</li>
            <li>It is very quick and easy to find information.</li>
            <li>It is easy to add new data and to edit or delete old data.</li>
            <li>Data can be searched easily, eg 'find all Ford cars'.</li>
            <li>Data can be sorted easily, for example into 'date first registered' order.</li>
            <li>Data can be imported into other applications, for example a mail-merge letter to a customer saying that an MOT test is due.</li>
            <li>More than one person can access the same database at the same time - multi-access.</li>
            <li>Security may be better than in paper files.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Database uses</h2>
        <p>When a database holds details about people, it's likely to include their first name, surname and their date of birth. In addition to this, specialist information is stored depending on the database's intended use.</p>
        <p>Organisations use databases for a variety of reasons:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-position: inside;">
            <li>the police have details of all known criminals in a database, eg crimes they've comitted.</li>
            <li>schools use a database to store details about their pupils, eg how many days they've been off school sick.</li>
            <li>a hospital will store details of all its patients in a database, eg a history of their health issues.</li>
            <li>the Government uses a database to store records of people's income tax payments.</li>
            <li>a database is used to keep track of all the drivers in central London who have (or haven't) paid the Congestion Charge.</li>
        </ul>
